         <h3>What is Carbon Credits?</h3>
         <h4>Innovating coffee farming through blockchain technology</h4>
         <p>Carbon credits are a way to measure and trade reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. They're like certificates that represent the removal or reduction of one ton of carbon dioxide or its equivalent in other greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. Companies or organizations can earn carbon credits by reducing their emissions or by investing in environmental projects that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, like planting trees or supporting renewable energy. These credits can then be bought and sold on carbon markets. They're used by businesses to meet regulatory requirements, offset their emissions, or demonstrate their commitment to fighting climate change. Overall, carbon credits play a vital role in encouraging sustainable practices and mitigating climate change.</p>

        <h4>HOW THEY WORKS?</h4>
        <p>Carbon credits function as a tool to incentivize and reward actions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They operate on the principle of "cap and trade," where a limit (or cap) is set on the total amount of emissions allowed in a certain period.</p>

      <div class="thirdContainerSubCont2">
        <div class="thirdContainerBox">
          <img src="assets/img/SustBox1.png" alt="">
          <h4>Emissions Reduction</h4>
          <p>Companies or projects that reduce their greenhouse gas emissions below the established cap can earn carbon credits. This reduction can be achieved through various means, such as improving energy efficiency, transitioning to renewable energy sources, or implementing carbon capture technologies.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="thirdContainerBox2">
          <img src="assets/img/SustBox2.png" alt="">
          <h4>Credit Generation</h4>
          <p>Each ton of emissions reduced earns a corresponding number of carbon credits. These credits are certified by accredited organizations and can be traded on carbon markets.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="thirdContainerBox3">
          <img src="assets/img/SustBox3.png" alt="">
          <h4>Trading</h4>
          <p>Carbon credits are bought and sold on specialized platforms or exchanges. Companies that struggle to meet their emissions targets can purchase credits from those who have surplus credits due to their emission reductions.</p>

          <img src="assets/img/SustBox4.png" alt="">
          <h4>Compliance and Offsetting</h4>
          <p>Carbon credits can be used by companies to comply with regulatory requirements regarding emissions limits. They can also be used for voluntary offsetting, where businesses or individuals choose to compensate for their carbon footprint by investing in projects that reduce emissions elsewhere, such as renewable energy projects or forest conservation initiatives.</p>

          <img src="assets/img/SustBox5.png" alt="">
          <h4>Environmental Impact</h4>
          <p> By creating a market value for emissions reductions, carbon credits encourage investment in environmentally friendly practices and technologies. They provide financial incentives for businesses to adopt cleaner processes and contribute to global efforts to combat climate change.</p>

        <h4>WE TAKE CARE OF OUR PLANET</h4>
        <p>The tokenization of coffee fields is not only a way to optimize production and improve the traceability of the coffee we love so much, but it is also a crucial step towards a cleaner and healthier future for our planet. By digitizing and tokenizing coffee fields, we are reducing the industry's carbon footprint, promoting responsible agricultural practices and contributing to the conservation of natural resources.</p>
        <p>Each token represents a commitment to sustainability and environmental protection. Each time we participate in the tokenization of a coffee field, we are making a clear statement that we value our planet and are willing to take concrete steps to protect it.</p>
        <p>At CafeToken, we firmly believe that the environment is our shared responsibility and that together we can make a difference. Let us continue to work together to build a future where sustainability and prosperity go hand in hand. Together, we can achieve a cleaner, greener, brighter world for all.</p>
